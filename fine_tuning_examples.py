            ### Card Descriptions:
            - **Card 5:**
            - Type: Power
            - Cost: 1
            - Whenever you draw a Status card, draw 1 card.

            - **Card 9:**
            - Type: Attack
            - Cost: 2
            - Exhaust all cards in your hand. Deal 7 damage for each Exhausted card. Exhaust.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 5 First:**
            - This card sets up a mechanism that allows you to draw additional cards when Status cards are drawn later.

            - **Playing Card 9 Next:**
            - You exhaust all cards in your hand. Card 5 would still be active.
            - You deal damage based on the number of cards you just exhausted. If you have drawn additional cards via Card 5 before playing Card 9, those will also be exhausted and counted towards the damage calculation.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Card 5 can result in drawing additional cards. Having more cards in your hand when Card 9 is played enhances its effect.
            - Card 9 exhasts all the cards in your hand, including any Status cards. The means that there will be fewer Status cards in your deck, reducing the continued effectiveness of Card 5 on later turns, because Card 5 effect is permanent.

            ### Conclusion:
            While this {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} has both a negative and positive effect, the positive effect is immediate which makes it more valuable.

            # Case 2
            ### Card Descriptions:
            - **Card 5:**
            - Type: Power
            - Cost: 1
            - Whenever you draw a Status card, draw 1 card.

            - **Card 10:**
            - Type: Skill
            - Cost: 1
            - This turn, your next Attack is played twice.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 5 First:**
            - You gain the ability to draw an additional card if you draw Status cards from this point on.

            - **Playing Card 10 Next:**
            - The next Attack card you play this turn will be played twice. If you have drawn additional cards via Card 5 before playing Card 10, there may be more Attack cards in your hand that you could play and have it be played twice because of Card 10.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The effectiveness of Card 10 is very sensitive to what Attack card is played after Card 10 that turn. Having Card 5 in play potentially leads to more draws, giving you more options for cards to play.

            ### Conclusion:
            There is small positive indirect {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} between the two cards, since playing Card 5 can result in having more options for what Attack is played twice through Card 10's effect.

            # Case 3
            ### Card Descriptions:
            - **Card 5:**
            - Type: Power
            - Cost: 1
            - Whenever you draw a Status card, draw 1 card.

            - **Card 8:**
            - Type: Attack
            - Cost: 0
            - Can only be played if every card in your hand is an Attack. Deal 14 damage.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 5 First:**
            - Sets an ongoing effect to draw additional cards if Status cards are drawn.

            - **Playing Card 8 Next:**
            - Card 8's conditions require that all cards in your hand must be Attacks. Since Card 5 is in play, it makes drawing a Status card more obstructive to Card 8's requirement, since any Status card drawn will trigger Card 5's effect, drawing an additional card which can be a non-Attack card.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Playing Card 5 first can create a scenario where Card 8 cannot be played.
            - As such, there’s a disadvantage from the combination, since the inclusion of Card 5 may block the play of Card 8.

            ### Conclusion:
            The sequence produces a negative effect, as Card 5 inadvertently prevents Card 8 from being played.

            ### Card Descriptions:
            - **Card 5:**
            - Type: Power
            - Cost: 1
            - Whenever you draw a Status card, draw 1 card.

            - Type: Skill
            - Cost: 1
            - Add 2 Wounds to your hand. Gain 15 Block.

            - **Playing Card 5 First:**
            - You gain the effect of drawing an additional card when any Status card is drawn.

            - **Playing Card 11 Next:**
            - You add 2 Wounds to your hand, which are Status cards, and gain 15 Block.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - By playing Card 11, you add Status cards to your hand that will end up in your deck and can be drawn later.
            - Since Card 5 has a permanent effect, whenever one of these Wound cards are drawn, you will draw  an additional card which would not have happened without Card 5 or 11 being played.

            ### Conclusion:
            Playing these cards leads to a positive {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}, as drawing Wounds allows you to trigger Card 5’s ability to draw more cards.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - When playing Card 9, Card 6 may or may not be in your hand. However, the effect of Card 6 has no unique impact on the effect of Card 9.

            ### Conclusion:

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Card 10 does not benefit from Card 6 since Card 6 resolves its effects before Card 10 is played.   

            ### Conclusion:

            # Case 8
            ### Card Descriptions:
            - **Card 6:**
            - Type: Attack
            - Cost: 1

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:

            - Type: Power
            - Cost: 0
            - At the start of your turn, lose 1 HP and draw 1 card.

            - Type: Attack
            - Cost: 2
            - Exhaust all cards in your hand. Deal 7 damage for each Exhausted card. Exhaust.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 7 First:**
            - From your next turn onward, at the start of each turn you will lose 1 HP and draw a card.

            - **Playing Card 9 Next:**
            - You exhaust all cards in your hand and deal damage based on the number of cards exhausted.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The energy or HP loss is not relevant in terms of any benefits gained from Card 9 directly.
            - However, the additional card drawn can enhance the effect of Card 9 since Card 9's effect is proportional to the number of cards in your hand.

            ### Conclusion:
            Playing these two cards in this order leads to a positive {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} since Card 9's effect is enhanced when there are more cards in your hand.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 7 First:**
            - From your next turn onward, at the start of each turn you will lose 1 HP and draw a card.

            - **Playing Card 10 Next:**
            - This card is played to set your next Attack this turn to be played twice for whatever cards exist in hand or drawn (if it's an Attack card).

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Having Card 7 in play leads to more cards drawn on future turns, but not this turn.
            - If Card 10 is played on a future turn, there will be more cards in your hand, some of which can be Attack cards. Because of this, there can be more options to choose from for Card 10 to affect.

            ### Conclusion:
            There is a positive {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect when these cards are played in this particular order since Card 7's effect can result in having more options for what Attack is played twice.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 7 First:**
            - From your next turn onward, at the start of each turn you will lose 1 HP and draw a card.

            - **Playing Card 8 Next:**
            - If drawing more Cards leads to having non-Attack cards, you can potentially be prevented from playing Card 8 since it relies on the condition of not holding any cards not labeled as Attack cards.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - If you hold non-Attack cards, it blocks Card 8. This results in a potential detriment if Card 7 causes you to draw such a card.

            ### Conclusion:
            There is a negative {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} since the ability to play Card 8 hinges on what cards you have in your hand . Playing Card 7 creates the possibility of drawing a non-Attack card—hence creating a negative {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.

            - Type: Power
            - Cost: 0
            - At the start of your turn, lose 1 HP and draw 1 card.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 7 First:**
            - From your next turn onward, at the start of each turn you will lose 1 HP and draw a card.

            - **Playing Card 11 Next:**
            - You add 2 Wounds (Status cards) to your hand and gain 15 Block.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The negative effect of adding Wounds from Card 11 directly hinders the positive effect of drawing an additional card each turn gained from Card 7, since the drawn cards now can be Wounds.
            - The positive effect of drawing an additional card each turn gained from Card 7 directly counteracts the negative effect of having your deck diluted with Wounds from Card 11.

            ### Conclusion:
            Given this {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} has both a positive and negative side and these sides are relatively balanced, we can consider this as having no significant {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - You have to consider that playing Card 10 after Card 8 doesn’t retroactively allow Card 8 to be played again and benefit.
            - Playing Card 8 does not influence future attacks played with Card 10.

            ### Conclusion:

            - Type: Attack
            - Cost: 0
            - Can only be played if every card in your hand is an Attack. Deal 14 damage.

            - In fact, the second copy does nothing but waste energy and adds no effect due to the first copy already making block last between turns.
            
            ### Conclusion:
            The engagement demonstrates negative {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} through playing the second Card 8 because the effect cannot compound and just wastes energy.

            - You lose 6 HP, gain 2 energy, and draw 3 additional cards before exhausting it.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Repeating the action results in an added stack of energy gain and card draw recursively. The downside is accrued HP loss.

            ### Conclusion:
            Although you're losing HP, gaining more energy and cards allows for many extra options and played cards since the energy and crad draw is beneficial to each cards effect, meaning there is a {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.

            ### Conclusion:
            This combination creates no specific interaction between Card 5 and Card 9.

            - Strength is doubled with exhaustion ensuing.

            - **Playing Card 12 Next:**
            - It deals damage based on the amount of cards exhausted, including how the strength boosting could bring better cumulative totals through higher numbers resulting.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The effectiveness of this particular {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} would remain consistent as Strength would only apply once to Card 12.

            ### Conclusion:
            This presents a positive {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} since the mechanics allow greater utilization of damage through the buildup of strengthened capabilities.

            - **Card 5:**
            - Type: Skill
            - Cost: 2
            - Double your current Block.

            - **Card 9:**
            - Type: Attack
            - Cost: 1
            - Deal 5 damage. If the enemy is Vulnerable, gain 1 energy and draw 1 card.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 5 First:**
            - You double your current Block. Let's assume you had X Block before playing, your new Block would be 2X.

            - **Playing Card 9 Next:**
            - Card 9 will deal 5 damage. There is no interaction between doubling Block and the effects of Card 9.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - There is no {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} between the two cards. Doubling your Block does not enhance the effectiveness of dealing damage or gaining energy from vulnerabilities since it’s unrelated to the Block played.

            ### Conclusion:
            No additional advantages or disadvantages arise from this sequence.

            - Create a copy of an Attack or Power card in your hand.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 5 First:**
            - You double your current Block.

            - **Playing Card 10 Next:**
            - You create a copy of an Attack or Power card in your hand. Block is unaffected, and Card 10 does not provide {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} with previous effects.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - As Card 10's effect is independent of Card 5, there’s no {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} or interaction between the two cards beyond individual independent effects.

            ### Conclusion:
            No {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effects or additional advantages exist between these two.

            - Cost: 1
            - This turn, your next Attack is played twice.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 5 First:**
            - You double your current Block.

            - **Playing Card 11 Next:**
            - This creates a buff for the next Attack played but does not interact with the Block gain from Card 5.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The doubling of the Block does not enhance the effect of having an Attack played twice. These two effects are independent from one another.

            ### Conclusion:
            No {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect exists between these plays, neither advantageous nor disadvantageous.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 5 First:**
            - You double your current Block.

            - **Playing Card 12 Next:**
            - There is no Exhaustion effect taking place, so the effect gets triggered only when an exhaust action follows.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The Block gain from Card 12 happens only on Exhaust actions. Since no {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} exists between the two effects, doubling your Block does not enhance the effect derived from Exhausting cards.       

            ### Conclusion:
            No combinatory effect is seen between these plays.

            - Type: Attack
            - Cost: 1
            - Deal 5 damage. If the enemy is Vulnerable, gain 1 energy and draw 1 card.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 6 First:**
            - You gain 2 Vulnerable.

            - **Playing Card 9 Next:**
            - Card 9 deals 5 damage to the enemy. Since the you are now Vulnerable, not the enemy, nothing else happens.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} here is nonexistent. Playing Card 6 first does not give an enemy vulnerable, which means Card 9 does not trigger the additional effects for energy and card draw.

            ### Conclusion:
            This sequence creates no {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} where playing Card 6 fails to empower Card 9.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 6 First:**
            - You gain 2 Vulnerable.

            - **Playing Card 10 Next:**
            - You create a copy of an Attack or Power card in your hand, but it does not interact or enhance any existing cards since it’s dependent on what is currently in hand.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Card 10 can create a copy of existing attacks or power cards, and since you need more energy to play that extra card, Card 6 provides that energy, making them work well off each other.

            ### Conclusion:
            A small additional advantage occurs in this sequence, leading to a small {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 6 First:**
            - You gain 2 Vulnerable.

            - **Playing Card 11 Next:**
            - This will allow your next Attack to be played twice that turn.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The increased vulnerability allows for enhanced damage, but only to the player. Any following Attack played twice does not benefit from vulnerability on you.       

            ### Conclusion:
            This sequence generates no {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} where Card 11 can not from the increased vulnerability from Card 6 since it is applied to you.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 6 First:**
            - You gain 2 Vulnerable.

            - **Playing Card 12 Next:**
            - You establish a future effect that grants Block whenever a card is Exhausted.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - There’s no direct destruction or {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} here. Card 12's effect links to exhaust activity that would normally lead to Block gains, not relevant with the effect of Card 6.

            ### Conclusion:
            No additional {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} interactions are present between these two.

            - Deal 5 damage. If the enemy is Vulnerable, gain 1 energy and draw 1 card.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 7 First:**
            - The enemy loses 2 Strength, and the card is then Exhausted.

            - **Playing Card 9 Next:**
            - Card 9 will deal 5 damage. There are no Vulnerable interactions preceding the attack from Card 7 and no further attacks resulting from the effect of Card 7.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The strength loss occurs before dealing damage, but Card 9 does not exploit any of these changes unless vulnerability is established. It simply does 5 damage without the benefit of exploiting vulnerabilities.

            ### Conclusion:
            Without Vulnerable preceding Card 9 being played, there’s no {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect to be noted.

            - The next Attack is played twice.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - No direct benefits or amplifications come from the interplay since the lowered strength of the enemy does not impact the damage done by the player.

            - The enemy loses 2 Strength followed by card Exhaustion.

            - **Playing Card 12 Next:**
            - Provides Block whenever an Exhausted card occurs.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Upon playing Card 7, it gets Exhasted, but because of the order of play, you do not trigger the gain of 3 Block from Card 12 as a result of card exhaustion in that scenario.

            ### Conclusion:
            This creates a no {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.

            - Card 9 will deal 5 damage, with no effect if enemies have not been made vulnerable yet by Card 8.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - While Card 8 deals AoE damage to all enemies, Card 9's conditional effect to gain an energy and draw a card is not applicable unless an enemy is actually Vulnerable. This sequence fails to provide {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Card 10 allows you to create a copy of Cards you already have. There’s nothing to improve via the sequence from playing Card 8, unless the copy created fits the criteria of being a beneficial attack.

            - **Playing Card 9 Next:**
            - Assuming you have played no other cards nor have any left (after playing Card 5), you will exhaust no cards, since card 5 was played.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - There’s no {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} here since you’re playing Card 5 and then cannot exhaust it with Card 9 for extra damage.

            ### Conclusion:
            The sequence yields no extra damage output distinct from playing each card independently.

            - **Card 5:**
            - Type: Attack
            - Cost: 4
            - Costs 1 less energy for each time you lose HP in combat. Deal 18 damage.

            - **Card 10:**
            - Type: Skill
            - Cost: 1
            - Gain 5 Block.

            ### Order of Events

            - You deal 18 damage.

            - **Playing Card 10 Next:**
            - You gain 5 Block.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - There is no direct interaction or {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} from playing them in this order. The Block gained doesn’t amplify or minimize the impact of damage dealt by Card 5.

            ### Conclusion:
            No additional advantages or disadvantages come from this sequence.

            - Type: Attack
            - Cost: 1
            - Deal 3 damage to a random enemy 3 times.

            ### Order of Events

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The damage from Card 6 does not enhance or affect the outcome of Card 5. These are two independent attacks without any interplay beyond their individual outputs.

            ### Conclusion:
            There is no effective {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} created in this sequence.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 5 First:**
            - You deal 18 damage.

            - **Playing Card 11 Next:**
            - This sets up an ongoing effect to draw cards and lose HP.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - There’s no substantive interplay here. The damage dealt does not affect Card 11 directly, and since Card 5 is played first, Card 11's effect does not change it.

            ### Conclusion:
            Such sequence offers no beneficial or detrimental {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect.

            - **Playing Card 9 Next:**
            - You then exhaust all remaining cards and you deal an additional 7 damage for each card exhausted.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - While there’s a reasonable independent benefit from playing both, neither attack card augments the result of the other directly.

            ### Conclusion:
            No significant {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} occurs due to the independent nature of the two cards.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - There’s no synergistic benefit or interaction between these two cards; each offers a separate benefit without affecting the other's outcome.

            ### Conclusion:
            No {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect arises in this sequence.

            - **Playing Second Card 6 Next:**
            - You now deal another 9 damage (again, 3 damage to random enemies).

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - In this case, each instance of playing Card 6 is stackable, yet remains independent without any alteration to the play interaction from the first play.   

            ### Conclusion:
            This demonstrates no {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect in terms of damage, since they are the same card without additional amplifying effects, this does just showcase independent outputs.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The damage done does not enhance or influence the effects of Card 11, as the effects remain separate.

            ### Conclusion:

            - You gain 30 Block.

            - **Playing Card 9 Next:**
            - You then exhaust all remaining cards and you deal an additional 7 damage for each card exhausted.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The combined play adds no value due to Card 7 not adding to Card 9’s effect, as you gain significant Block and then have exhaustion triggering for damage seperately.        

            ### Conclusion:
            The lack {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} here offers a neutral result from this play combination.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - There’s no effect seen when playing these two cards in succession. What happens is merely independent Block gain without any added effect related to each card's interactions.

            - **Playing Card 9 Next:**
            - Upon using Card 9, you exhaust the random Attack obtained from Card 8.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Card 9 exploits the effect of exhausting to gain damage, however since Card 8 does not add to the number of exhaustable cards, they do not interact.

            ### Conclusion:
            This scenario yields no {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} because card 8 does not net extra damage or effects for card 9.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 5 First:**
            - You gain 2 energy and then the card is Exhausted.

            - **Playing Card 10 Next:**
            - This card is not played yet, so no cards have been Exhausted when you play it.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - There’s no {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} since Card 10 does not trigger any action from the first card being exhausted before it is played.

            ### Conclusion:
            No special advantages generated in this sequence.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The effect of Card 11 is independent; However, the energy from Card 5 allows for additional card play from Card 10's draws.

            ### Conclusion:
            A {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect exists; the played cards just act independently.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 5 First:**
            - You gain 2 energy. The card is then Exhausted.

            - **Playing Card 8 Next:**
            - You do not gain any effects at the moment but do set up an ongoing effect.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Card 8 provides future benefits but not upon its current iteration. Therefore, playing Card 5 generates energy but does not directly influence Card 8's activation.

            ### Conclusion:
            No {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} or notable interaction occurs here.

            - **Playing Card 9 Next:**
            - You lose 3 HP and gain 2 energy.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The damage effect of Vulnerable does not play into the mechanics of Card 9; thus, both cards operate independently here.

            ### Conclusion:
            No {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect is observable in this combination.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The two cards do not interact at all; thus, they are independent of each other, with no benefit derived from the sequence.

            - **Playing Card 11 Next:**
            - You could potentially gain 2 energy, draw 3 cards, and exhaust Card 11, but none of these actions will amplify the effect of Card 6.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - There’s a small benificial effect between the two cards when combined, since Card 6 lets you play more cards drawn from Card 11.

            ### Conclusion:
            A {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} emerges as more options become available.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Because Card 11 gains energy, Card 8's additional draw is benificial.

            - You gain 8 Block and draw a card.

            - **Playing Card 9 Next:**
            - After drawing a card, you check your hand to see if it only contains Attack cards. If it does, you can deal 14 damage.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - There is a potential negative {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} here. By playing Card 5 first, you are drawing a card which will never help fulfill the requirement for playing Card 9, in case you have not drawn another Attack card.
            - However, if the drawn card is an Attack card, Card 9 would gain no additional effect.

            ### Conclusion:
            The effectiveness of Card 9 depends on whether Card 5 allows you to fulfill the condition of having only Attack cards. If it does, you get a total of 14 damage after gaining 8 Block; otherwise, you gain 8 Block and do not attack.

            - There is a small negative {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} between Cards 5 and 10, as both operate independently, and Card 5 makes Card 10 harder to play.

            - Cost: 1
            - Whenever you draw a Status or Curse card, deal 6 damage to all enemies.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 5 First:**
            - You gain 8 Block and draw a card.

            - **Playing Card 11 Next:**
            - If the drawn card is a Status or Curse, then Card 11 activates afterward to deal 6 damage to all enemies.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The cards are played in the wrong order to provide a {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The skills operate independent of one another. Card 5 does not influence the energy gain effect in association with Card 12.
            - However, it does provide new options and energy to play those options.

            - If the conditions are satisfied (no non-Attack cards), you deal 14 damage.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - There is a small interconnection between Cards 6 and 9. The drawn Dazed may negatively impact the ability to play Card 9 next.

            ### Conclusion:

            - **Playing Card 10 Next:**
            - You can now pay the card’s cost depending on your HP loss and deal 18 damage.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Card 10 operates independently of Card 6. Losing HP does not assist in creating further advantages between actions.

            ### Conclusion:
            No enhanced interaction between these two plays.

            - The Dazed allows opportunity to enable extra damage.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The added Daze card makes Card 11's effect more likely to happen.

            - **Playing Card 12 Next:**
            - You gain 2 energy with no elevated connection to prior card plays.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Each card continues to operate without aiding additional effectiveness through their execution.
            - However, Card 6 adds the possibility for Card 12 to be drawn in a hand with fewer cards, reducing its effectiveness.

            ### Conclusion:
            A small negative {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} emerges here.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 7 First:**
            - Skills now cost 0 energy to play and will be exhausted upon use.

            - **Playing Card 9 Next:**
            - If every card after the use of the Skills is an Attack, it can be played.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Playing Card 7 first allows you to play more skills without cost. This means your ability to play Card 9 becomes higher.

            ### Conclusion:
            Playing a Power card like Card 7 directly supports Card 9 due to the energy cost reduction and exhaustion of Skills, indicates a positive outcome.

            - **Playing Card 10 Next:**
            - The effect of playing Card 10 remains unchanged.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The effect of Card 7 does not improve or reduce Card 10's performance, since this Attack depends on HP rather than the Skill effect of Card 7.

            ### Conclusion:
            Therefore, no advantage or disadvantage arises from this interaction creating a neutral setup.

            - Here, no additional benefits or interactions arise between Cards 7 and 11 through this order.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 7 First:**
            - Skills are played at no cost and will be exhausted.

            - **Playing Card 12 Next:**
            - This card would be free to play, providing energy and being exhausted.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Card 12 being played while Card 7 is in effect gives an immediate energy boost—however, the exhausting ability that follows does not create {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} with other cards in hand.

            ### Conclusion:
            The outcome here is advantageous through the energy gain but doesn't create further interactions with respect to both cards specific to the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} order, thus making it a moderate advantage.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 8 First:**
            - You gain 7 Block but exhaust a random card from your hand, potentially losing a non-Attack card.

            - **Playing Card 9 Next:**
            - This depends on whether you still have Attack cards remaining in hand. If you have lost a non-Attack as a consequence of Card 8, then you can play Card 9 easier.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The probability of exhausting a non-Attack card allows for playing Card 9.

            ### Conclusion:
            As such, this sequence has the potential for a positive {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} because Card 8 helps to play Card 9.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The interaction is entirely independent; however, losing your options for Card 12's energy increases the possibility of leftover energy, which does not carry over between turns.

            - You draw no additional card because of Card 5. Then, you place a card from your hand back on top of your draw pile.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The initial card draw from Card 5 is effective, followed by Card 11, which does not get to draw because of Card 5.

            ### Conclusion:
            Because the effects cut off Card 11's draw, the sequence leads to a negative {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.

            ### Card Descriptions:
            - **Card 5:**
            - Type: Skill
            - Cost: 0
            - Draw 3 cards. You cannot draw additional cards this turn.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 5 First:**
            - You draw 3 cards.

            - **Playing Card 5 Again:**
            - Card 5 states you cannot draw additional cards this turn, leading to no new draws.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Playing Card 5 first followed again by the same card produces no further advantage and just wastes energy. The limit on drawing more cards leads to ineffective redundancy.

            ### Conclusion:
            The combination of plays leads to a reduction in effectiveness, a negative {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.

            - Gain 8 Block. Draw 1 card.

            - **Card 9:**
            - Type: Attack
            - Cost: 2
            - Exhaust all non-Attack cards in your hand. Deal 16 damage.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 6 First:**
            - Gain 8 Block and draw 1 card.

            - **Playing Card 9 Next:**
            - You now exhaust the remaining non-Attack cards in your hand, which could include the card drawn from Card 6.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Playing Card 6 first gives a card draw, and the card drawn can be a non-Attack card. This would then be removed by Card 9.

            ### Conclusion:
            The Exhaustion leads to a direct negative {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.

            Final score:
            -1

            # Case 6
            ### Card Descriptions:
            - **Card 6:**
            - Type: Skill
            - Cost: 1
            - Gain 8 Block. Draw 1 card.

            - **Card 10:**
            - Type: Attack
            - Cost: 0
            - Can only be played if every card in your hand is an Attack. Deal 14 damage.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 6 First:**
            - You gain 8 Block and draw 1 card.

            - **Playing Card 10 Next:**
            - This card will only work worth if all cards in hand are Attack types; that means unless the card drawn through Card 6 was one, there’s no possibility of utilizing this effectively.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The outcome of Block gained does not project into a beneficial play with Card 10 unless favorable circumstances arise. So the only thing that happens is the drawn cards possibly locking possible damage output.

            ### Conclusion:
            The play sequence fails to yield a cooperative interaction, hence keeping things disjointed.

            Final score:
            -1

            - Cost: 0
            - Draw 1 card. Place a card from your hand on top of your draw pile. Exhaust.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 6 First:**
            - You gain 8 Block and draw a card.

            - **Playing Card 11 Next:**
            - Follow up this action for additional drawing and returning a card to the top of your draw pile.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The opportunity to rotate or maintain dynamic control is effective here, with drawing leading to the ability to recast priority cards. This works well through both skills having an interaction that enriches ongoing plays.

            ### Conclusion:
            Thus, the sequence generates a positive interplay.

            - Gain 8 Block and draw 1 card.

            - **Playing Card 5 Next:**
            - Draw 3 additional cards.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Here, the plays yield a large amount of draw, leading to a sprawling hand but dont enhance each others effects.        

            ### Conclusion:
            The cards give more draw, but do not enhance each other's effects

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 7 First:**
            - You deal 21 damage and add a Burn to the discard pile.

            - **Playing Card 9 Next:**
            - Subsequently, you exhaust all non-Attack cards and deal additional damage.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The Burn added by Card 7 can affect player strategy but the attacks remain independent of each other. 

            ### Conclusion:
            While you may be able to exhaust the burn card, it is not significant enough to matter. There is no {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.

            - Can only be played if every card in your hand is an Attack. Deal 14 damage.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 7 First:**
            - Deal 21 damage and incur a Burn from which counts but a correlation shines true in that it does not conditionally affect the play afterwards.

            - **Playing Card 10 Next:**
            - The likelihood of ability to play card 10 post remains dependent on current card draw. Otherwise, it works outside of a continuous effect.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The ability to now draw the Burn card and lose your ability to play Card 10 makes this interference realistic to expect.

            ### Conclusion:
            The play outcome fails to bring out positive effects, and leaves behind only negative {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.

            - Cost: 0
            - Draw 1 card. Place a card from your hand on top of your draw pile. Exhaust.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 7 First:**
            - The play’s intent manifests damage with Burn provided afterwards.

            - **Playing Card 11 Next:**
            - You can execute drawing followed with establishing card priority in retreat which follows interaction.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Each card’s effects here play independently. The initial attack allows damage but follows up seamlessly when contrast recall comes into play from any drawn behavior post alignment assessment.    

            ### Conclusion:
            Despite of outcomes which can deter health overall, no combos or interactions between resultant independence fall out too.

            - Draw 3 cards. You cannot draw additional cards this turn.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 7 First:**
            - You apply damage alongside a Burn.

            - **Playing Card 5 Next:**
            - That is to say, following up allows behavior dependent drawing.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Following up with the draw makes the Burn card more likely to be drawn this turn.

            ### Conclusion:
            This higher chance of getting the Burn card leads to a negative {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} between card pair.

            - 9 damage and follow up with draw.

            - **Playing Card 9 Next:**
            - Then proceed to deal an additional 16.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The draw directly increases your odds of Exhausting more cards from Card 9.

            ### Conclusion:
            This interference leads to a negative {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.

            - Deal damage again while ensuring simultaneous drawing available.

            - **Playing Card 10 Next:**
            - Again this requires that all current cards be Attack cards to play effectively.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The draw directly decreases your odds of being able to play Card 10.

            ### Conclusion:
            The detrimental effects of drawing before Card 10 makes the sequence harder to achieve.

            - Playing onto damage occurs followed up by a card draw.

            - **Playing Card 11 Next:**
            - Evaluate options which come from any replacements seen after card draw is executed.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Because you are able to choose from more cards to add to the top, Card 8 benifits Card 11's effect.

            ### Conclusion:
            These two cards lead to a benificial {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} as you gain more options for play.
