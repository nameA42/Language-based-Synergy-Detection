        """You are studying a new card game. In this game, the player have a deck of cards.
        The game is single player and is played in a number of turns. The game is played against one or more enemies.
        The player has some amount of HP. If player's HP reaches zero, the player loses.
        Each of the enemies also have some amount of HP. Any enemy with zero HP dies and would not affect the game anymore. If all the enemies die, the player wins the game.
        At the start of every turn, each enemy also shows an intention. This intention describes what action that enemy performs after the player ends his turn. Example enemy actions are "deal 5 damage" or "gain 5 block".
        There are four card piles in the game: draw pile, discard pile, exhaust pile, and your hand. Initially, the player starts the game by shuffling the deck of cards into the draw pile. The other piles are empty.
        Every turn, these actions are performed in this exact order:
        1. The player gains some amount of energy. Most of the time this amount is 3, but some items or cards in the game can change this amount.
        2. The player draws some number of cards from the draw pile into his hand. Most of the time this number is 5, but some items or cards in the game can change this amount.
        * If there are not enough cards in the draw pile, all the cards in the discard pile shuffle back into the draw pile. Then the remaining cards are drawn.
        3. The player plays as many cards as he wants, as long as he has enough energy to play them. Then he ends his turn.
        4. When the player ends his turn, all the remaining cards in his hand are moved to the discard pile. New cards will be drawn next turn.
        5. When the player ends his turn, the enemies perform their actions that was shown as their intention at the start of the turn.

        Card Type: Either Attack, Skill or Power. Power cards are played and then removed from that battle, but Attack or Skill cards move to discard pile if they are played. We also have Status or Curse cards which are unplayable and most of the time are the cards that disadvantage the player in some way.
        Block: Until next turn, prevents damage. For example, if the player gains 5 block, and the enemy deals 7 damage to him that turn, the player loses only 2 HP and all their block. It only lasts one turn, so if there are any remining blocks on the enemy or the player, the blocks are removed right before they perform their next set of actions.
        Vulnerable: Take 50% more damage from Attack damage. Note that this only applies to damage coming from an Attack type card or an enemy Attack action. The number of Vulnerable shows how many turns it will last.
        Weak: Deal 25% less damage with Attacks. Note that this only applies to damage coming from an Attack type card or an enemy Attack action. The number of Weak shows how many turns it will last.
        Strength: Adds additional damage to Attacks. Note that this only applies to damage coming from an Attack type card or an enemy Attack action.
        Exhaust: Remove card until end of combat.
        Wound: An unplayable card with no effects.
        Ethereal: If an Ethereal card is in player's hand at the end of turn, it is Exhasted.
        Dazed: An unplayable card which is also Ethereal.
        Innate: Start each combat with this card in your hand.
        Burn: An unplayable card. If the card is in player's hand at the end of his turn, the player will take 2 damage.
        X cost card: If a card's cost is X, it means that when the card is played, it will consume all the avaialble energy the player has. This number of energy consumed is X, and the effect of the card is often described in terms of X.
        When a card says "At the start of your turn ..." or "At the end of your turn ...", it means this effect will happen every single turn at the start of player's turn or at the end of player's turn.

            Basically, a {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect is when two cards have some additional effect when played together when compared to playing them separately.
            For example, let's say there is a card A that says "deal 5 damage and apply 1 Vulnerable" and a card B that says "deal 4 damage". If a player plays card A, he deals 5 damage, and if card B is played in a separate scenairo, it applies 4 damage. This is 9 damage in total. But if the player first plays card A and then card B after (in the same turn), card A deals 5 damage and card B deals 6 damage (instead of 4, because the enemy is vulnerable). So, in general the player does 5 + 6 = 11 damage instead of 9. We call this a positive {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}, since this extra effect is advantaging the player.
            {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} is dependant on the order of cards. For example, if the player plays card B first and then card A, card B does 4 damage, and card A does 5 damage and applies Vulnerable. That Vulnerable effect can be beneficial in combination with other cards played later, but the two cards B and A in this order don't have a {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.
            For another example of cards that don't have {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}, let's say card C says "deal 15 damage and gain 1 Weak", and card D says "Gain 5 Block". Card C has it's own effect, dealing damage and applying Weak to the player himself, which can has interesting effects in the game. But, if we played card C and then D, there is no {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}, since there is no additional effect from this combination. Same for if play card D and then C, again there is no extra effect.
            Some cards also have a negative {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}. For example, if you play card C and then card B, card C deals 15 damage, and card B deals 25% less damage (3 instead of 4), so you do 15 + 3 = 18 damage, which is less than if you look at the cards in isolation (15 damage and 4 damage). Note that again, order matters. Playing B first and then C doesn't have any {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}, positive or negative.
            The {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_PLURAL} can be normal, strong, or weak. Weak simulations are when there is a lot of setup or some other situations needed for that {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}, or if the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} itself is not that strong of an effect.
            Now, given two cards, I want you to first describe their {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}, if any. I want you to think about this effect carefully. Again, some cards might not have a {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} at all. When trying to understand the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}, we want to think about the effect of the cards, played in the exact given order, either immediately or after waiting some number of turns. Let's also assume that you have enough energy to play them in the same turn if needed, but if you think there are some considerations from one card to another that can be seen as a {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}, I want you to describe it.
            Second, I want you to give this description, tell me if the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} is positive or negative, and how strong it is. Let's say, something like card A and B is a normal {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}. If the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect is stronger, we call it strong and if it's weaker, very situational, or requies a lot of setup, we call it weak.
            Finally, I want to give me a final number at the end of your response in a single line.
            0: no {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}
            1: normal positive {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}

            -0.5: weak negative {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}

            A {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect is when two cards have some additional effect when played together when compared to playing them separately.
            Let's say we have two cards, card A and card B. Each card has its own positive and negative effects, and can be strong or weak in different situations.
            Now, suppose we play card A in some scenario S with some other cards. Suppose we play card B in scenario S with some other cards.
            Is there a possible scenario S in which playing card A, then card B, would give us additional advantages or disadvantages when compared to the effects of card A in scenario S and card B in scenario S?
            If in most scenarios, there is an extra advantagous effects of playing the cards together, we call this a positive {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.
            If in most cases, there is a disadvantages additional effect when A and then B is played (compared to playing them separately), we call this a negative {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.
            Note that:
            - When we say "play card A, then card B", this can mean playing B immediately after playing A, or after playing other cards in between, or even after passing a few turns in between.
            - When we talk about {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} between card A and card B, only consider {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} BETWEEN A AND B. For example, if card A has a lot of {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} with other cards, it doesn't matter, because playing card A with other cards would still give us those effects. We want to see what additional effects we get from A and B together.

            2. **Effects Breakdown:**
            - **First, Card 1 is played.** It deals its full 18 damage immediately. The energy cost can be reduced, assuming the player has lost HP, but that {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} is outside the effects between Card 1 then 2.
            - **Next, Card 2 is played.** This card deals 8 damage and applies 2 Vulnerable to the enemy. However, since the damage from Card 2 applies *after* Card 1 has already dealt damage, the Vulnerable effect does not enhance Card 1’s damage at all.

            3. **{SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} Result:**
            - When played in this order, the total damage becomes **18 (from Card 1) + 8 (from Card 2) = 26 damage.**
            - If Card 2 were played first (which can be done if energy allows), it would deal only 8 damage and apply Vulnerable, but Card 1 would still only deal 18 damage afterward without any enhancement from the Vulnerable effect.

            4. **Conclusion on {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:**
            - The {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} here doesn't actually result in an increased damage output because Card 1's damage does not benefit from the Vulnerable effect that Card 2 applies afterward. Therefore, there is no positive {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} between these two cards in this order; they simply contribute separately to the total damage. They also don't have any non-damage related {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_PLURAL}.

            ### Synergy Strength:
            - Since there is **no additional effect** from the order of these cards, we can say they have **no {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}**.

            2. **Effects Breakdown:**
            - **First, Card 2 is played.** It deals 8 damage, and then, applies 2 Vulnerable to the enemy. The application of Vulnerable means the enemy will take 50% more damage from Attack damage this turn and the next.
            - **Next, Card 1 is played.** This card will now deal its full 18 damage. However, since the enemy is Vulnerable and this card is an Attack Type card, the damage from Card 1 is increased by 50%. Thus, Card 1 will deal **18 + (18 * 0.5) = 27 damage**.

            3. **{SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} Result:**
            - When played in this order, the total damage becomes **8 (from Card 2) + 27 (from Card 1 with Vulnerable effect) = 35 damage.**
            - If played separately, Card 2 would deal the 8 damage and apply the vulnerable, but Card 1 would only deal its 18 damage, resulting in **18 + 8 = 26 damage** without any {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.

            4. **Conclusion on {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:**
            - In this order, playing Card 2 first to apply Vulnerable before playing Card 1 significantly increases the total damage, demonstrating a clear positive {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}. The addition of the Vulnerable means that the damage from Card 1 is effectively enhanced.

            ### {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} Strength:

            - **Next, Card 1 is played.** Because the player lost HP from playing Card 3, the energy cost of Card 1 will be reduced.

            3. **{SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} Result:**
            - Since Card 3 was played first, it allows Card 1's cost to be reduced by 1 (assuming the player has lost HP), and it will still execute its full 18 damage. The energy gained from Card 3 (2 energy) means the player can comfortably play Card 1 without an issue regarding energy cost.
            - The total damage done when played in this order is **18 damage** from Card 1, as the previous HP loss does not provide additional benefits for this particular execution.

            - **Next, Card 2 is played.** This card deals 8 damage and applies 2 Vulnerable to the enemy.     

            3. **{SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} Result:**
            - When Card 4 is played first, the player now has 7 Block, which helps mitigate damage from any incoming attacks during the enemy's turn after they play Card 2.
            - The Block itself doesn't enhance the damage from Card 2. Applying Vulnerable means that the enemy will take 50% more damage from future attacks, which can be especially valuable if further Attack cards are played later during this turn or in subsequent turns.
            - However, in the immediate context of Card 4 followed by Card 2, the damage output is **8 (from Card 2)**, and there is no interaction between the cards.

            4. **Conclusion on {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:**
            - There is no {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} here. The Vulnerable effect can help future cards, but doesn't affect this scenario and compared to playing the cards in isolation and adding up their effects, there is no difference. There is a possibility that Card 4 exhausting some other card can result in more Attack cards remaining and better use of Vulnerable in the future, but it is as likely to exhaust a skill card and make it harder to use the Vulnerable effect in the future. The Block doesn't create any interaction between the cards.

            ### {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} Strength:
            - No {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} exists.

            2. **Effects Breakdown:**
            - **First, Card 4 is played.** The player gains 7 Block and exhausts a random card from their hand. The Block will absorb up to 7 damage until the player's next turn.
            - **Next, Card 1 is played.** Card 1 will deal 18 damage. The energy cost of Card 1 might be affected by how much HP the player has lost previously in combat, but with Card 4 being played first, the player has not lost any HP yet (only gained Block).

            3. **{SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} Result:**
            - Card 4 gives some Block and Card 1 is dealing damage. In combination, the have the same exact effect.
            - The direct damage output from this combination remains **18 damage (from Card 1)**, and there is no enhancement of damage based on the previous play.
            - However, there is an extra effect: having that extra 7 Blocks makes it less likely to receive damage. As discussed before, we can imagine some number of turns have passed between playing the two cards. So, in that case, it would be more likely to have a higher cost for Card 1, since Card 4 can make it less likely to receive damage in that turn.

            4. **Conclusion on {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:**
            - There is a small possibility that Card 4 prevents the player from receiving any damage in the turn it is played. While this is normally positive, there is a small extra negative effect that the player gets damage one less time before playing Card 1, making Card 1 slightly more expensive.

            ### {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} Strength:
            - The likelihood of this happening is very small. First, there should be incoming damage with an amount that playing Card 4 is the difference between receiving any damage and not receiving any damage. Second, there should be a number of turns before playing the Card 1. Third, Card 1 should have a cost more than 0 for this effect to be important. Because this is very situational, the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} is **weak**.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:

            1. **Order of Play - Card 1, then Card 2:**
            - **Playing Card 1 First:**
                - You deal 18 damage to the enemy.
                - The energy cost reduction mechanic of Card 1 does not directly affect Card 2 unless HP loss influences the sequence in some other conditional way.
            
            - **Playing Card 2 Next:**
                - After Card 1, Card 2 deals 8 damage and applies 2 turns of Vulnerable.
                - Vulnerable does not retroactively enhance Card 1's damage, as it should be applied *before* dealing maximum damage.

            ### {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} Analysis:
            - **{SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} Effectiveness:**
            - The ideal scenario would be to apply Vulnerable before dealing high damage to maximize impact, but here, Card 1 is played first, negating this potential synergy.
            - There is no inherent synergy gained by playing Card 1 before Card 2. The ordering does not yield any extra advantage or disadvantage compared to playing them separately, especially since Vulnerable enhances future damage, not past damage.

            ### Conclusion:
            Since playing Card 1 followed by Card 2 does not create an advantageous effect when considering the order of operations, and since no special disadvantage arises from this sequence beyond not maximizing potential damage output, there isn’t a notable {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect here.

            - **{SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} Effectiveness:**

            Since playing Card 1 followed by Card 2 does not create an advantageous effect when considering the order of operations, and since no special disadvantage arises from this sequence beyond not maximizing potential damage output, there isn’t a notable {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect here.

            - **Playing Card 1 Next:**
                - Card 1 is now able to take advantage of the Vulnerable status applied by Card 2, since it applies Attack damage.
                - When Card 1 deals 18 damage, with the opponent being Vulnerable, it actually deals 27 damage (18 damage increased by 50%). This increases the total damage output from the sequence of plays.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Playing Card 2 first and applying Vulnerable means that Card 1's damage is increased by 50% due to the Vulnerable status.
            - The combined damage of these plays is effectively 35 damage (8 from Card 2 and 27 from Card 1 under vulnerability effects), compared to 26 damage (8 + 18) if Vulnerable were not in place when Card 1 was played.
            - The described {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} is between Card 2 and 1, since removing any of these two cards from the scenario disrupts the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.

            ### Conclusion:
            This sequence creates a positive synergy due to the effective use of Vulnerable status to amplify damage from Card 1, making it a positive {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.

            - Costs 4 energy initially but costs 1 less for each time you lose HP in combat.
            - Deals 18 damage.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:

            1. **Order of Play - Card 2, then Card 1:**
            - **Playing Card 2 First:**
                - You deal 8 damage to the enemy and apply 2 turns of Vulnerable, increasing subsequent Attack damage by 50%.
            
            - **Playing Card 1 Next:**
                - Card 1 is now able to take advantage of the Vulnerable status applied by Card 2.
                - When Card 1 deals 18 damage, with the opponent being Vulnerable, it actually deals 27 damage (18 damage increased by 50%). This significantly increases the total damage output from the sequence of plays.

            ### {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} Analysis:
            - **{SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} Effectiveness:**
            - Playing Card 2 first and applying Vulnerable means that Card 1's damage is increased by 50% due to the Vulnerable status. This is the kind of synergy one looks for in setting up a sequence of plays.
            - The combined damage of these plays is effectively 35 damage (8 from Card 2 and 27 from Card 1 under vulnerability effects), compared to 26 damage (8 + 18) if Vulnerable were not in place when Card 1 was played.

            ### Conclusion:
            This sequence creates a positive synergy due to the effective use of Vulnerable status to amplify damage from Card 1, making it a positive {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.

            1. **Order of Play - Card 1, then Card 3:**
            - **Playing Card 1 First:**
                - Initially costs 4 energy and deals 18 damage.
                - Your current HP loss from playing Card 1 is irrelevant before playing Card 3.

            - **Playing Card 3 Next:**
                - You lose 3 HP, which potentially activates the effect of reducing Card 1's cost if played in future turns.
                - Gain 2 additional energy. However, since Card 1 has already been played, the immediate scenario doesn’t directly benefit from the extra energy unless it allows you to play other cards.

            - **{SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} Effectiveness:**
            - The play order implies no immediate synergy because any potential benefit from Card 3's effect on Card 1 is realized only in future plays of Card 1, provided it's repeatedly drawn in combat.
            - Card 3 grants more resources (energy) and theoretically allows for more plays, but for the immediate sequence of Card 1 then Card 3, there are no direct efficiency gains or additional effects.

            ### Conclusion:
            Since the described order doesn't produce an immediate advantageous or disadvantageous effect, considering the given conditions, there is no {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} in the sequence where Card 1 is played before Card 3.

            - **Playing Card 1 Next:**
                - The cost of Card 1 is now reduced by 1 due to the HP loss from Card 3.

            ### {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} Analysis:
            - **{SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} Effectiveness:**
            - Playing Card 3 first directly synergizes with Card 1 by reducing Card 1’s cost through the HP loss mechanic.
            - The extra energy provided is not part of the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect, since it is not part of the interaction between the two cards.

                - Since Card 2 has already used up most of your energy, the additional 2 energy from Card 3 would allow you to regain some resource availability for additional plays in the same turn.
                - The 3 HP loss from Card 3 does not directly interact with Card 2 because Vulnerable affects damage taken, not energy or HP mechanics.

            ### {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} Analysis:
            - **{SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED} Effectiveness:**
            - Playing Card 2 after Card 3 allows for potential further plays due to the energy burst from Card 3. However, there is no direct synergy between the cards' effects themselves.
            - Card 3 provides additional energy but playing it after Card 2 just restores some energy spent, which is useful for continuing the turn with more plays but not a synergistic {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} specific to these two cards' interactions.

            ### Conclusion:
            The sequence offers no notable synergistic interaction beyond regaining energy to play more cards. While this order may allow for greater flexibility in a turn by reopening energy options, nothing about the cards’ effects inherently enhances or diminishes the other's utility.

            1. **Order of Play - Card 4, then Card 2:**
            - Playing Card 4 confers 7 Block and exhausts a random card. This can impact any card, but it’s important to note this does not specifically interact with Card 2’s mechanism or effects.
            - After playing Card 4, if Card 2 is still in hand, you can play Card 2 normally, dealing 8 damage and applying 2 Vulnerable.

            ### Conclusion:
            Given that the risk of losing a card to exhaustion from Card 4 is an inherent risk not specific to Card 2, the sequence doesn't introduce any unique advantages or disadvantages specifically related to Card 2 beyond the inherent exhausting mechanic. Thus, there is no direct {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect due to the specific ordering of these cards.

            - **Playing Card 4 First:**
                - You gain 7 Block to protect against incoming damage, which is generally positive.       
                - A random card from your hand is exhausted. This is a risk inherent to Card 4 but doesn't specifically impact Card 1 more than any other card.

            - **Playing Card 1 Next:**
                - Gaining Block reduces the potential to take damage this turn, which could have reduced Card 1’s energy cost if the player would have taken HP loss.
                - Although gaining Block is beneficial for immediate protection, it indirectly reduces the possibility of taking advantage of Card 1’s cost reduction mechanic.

            ### Conclusion:
            Considering both the subtle negative synergy between gaining Block and potentially reducing Card 1's cost, the sequence can be considered a slight negative {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} due to the fact that playing Card 4 first may inadvertently result in a less optimal use of resources for playing Card 1.

            - The repeated card exhaustion could limit your strategic options, but it's not specific to the combination itself.
            - There’s no direct synergy or additional interplay between the two instances of Card 4 beyond their individual effects stacking.

            ### Conclusion:
            The sequential play of two Card 4s results in stacking of Block, a straightforward cumulative effect that does not introduce new positive or negative synergy beyond the individual card effects. As such, there isn't a net new {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect present.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - The ideal scenario would be to apply Vulnerable before dealing damage to maximize impact, but here, Card 1 is played first, negating this potential synergy.
            - There is no inherent synergy gained by playing Card 1 before Card 2. The ordering does not yield any extra advantage or disadvantage compared to playing them separately, especially since Vulnerable enhances future damage, not past damage.

            ### Conclusion:
            Since playing Card 1 followed by Card 2 does not create an advantageous effect when considering the order of operations, and since no special disadvantage arises from this sequence beyond not maximizing potential damage output, there isn’t a notable {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect here.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Playing Card 2 first and applying Vulnerable means that Card 1's damage is increased by 50% due to the Vulnerable status.
            - The combined damage of these plays is effectively 35 damage (8 from Card 2 and 27 from Card 1 under vulnerability effects), compared to 26 damage (8 + 18) if Vulnerable were not in place when Card 1 was played.
            - The described {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} is between Card 2 and 1, since removing any of these two cards from the scenario disrupts the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD}.

            - Type: Attack
            - Cost: 4
            - Costs 1 less energy for each time you lose HP in combat. Deal 18 damage.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 3 First:**
                - You lose 3 HP, activating the cost reduction mechanic of Card 1.
                - Unrelated to Card 1, you also gain 2 additional energy, increasing your resource pool for the current turn.
            
            - **Playing Card 1 Next:**
                - The cost of Card 1 is now reduced by 1 due to the HP loss from Card 3.
                - This lets you save 1 energy, which can be used to play additional cards during your turn.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Playing Card 3 first directly synergizes with Card 1 by reducing Card 1’s cost through the HP loss mechanic.
            - The extra energy provided by Card 3 is not part of the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect, since it is not specific to these two cards. Card 3 would have increased the available energy even if Card 1 was not part of the scenario.

            ### Conclusion:
            The play order of Card 3 followed by Card 1 results in a positive {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} due to the immediate cost reduction, which optimizes your energy usage and potentially broadens your strategic options for the rest of the turn.

            - Type: Attack
            - Cost: 2
            - Deal 8 damage. Apply 2 Vulnerable.

            - **Card 3:**
            - Type: Skill
            - Cost: 0
            - Lose 3 HP. Gain 2 Energy.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 2 First:**
                - You spend 4 energy to deal 8 damage and apply 2 Vulnerable to an enemy.
            
            - **Playing Card 3 Next:**
                - You gain 2 energy from Card 3. However, this gain is not part of the interaction between these two cards, and will happen even if Card 2 was not part of this scenario.
                - The 3 HP loss from Card 3 does not directly interact with Card 2.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Playing Card 2 after Card 3 allows for potential further plays due to the energy burst from Card 3. However, there is no direct synergy between the cards' effects themselves.
            - Card 3 provides additional energy but playing it after Card 2 just restores some energy spent, which is useful for continuing the turn with more plays but not a synergistic {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} specific to these two cards' interactions.

            ### Conclusion:
            The sequence offers no notable synergistic interaction beyond regaining energy to play more cards. While this order may allow for greater flexibility in a turn by reopening energy options, nothing about the cards’ effects inherently enhances or diminishes the other's utility.

            - Type: Skill
            - Cost: 1
            - Gain 7 Block. Exhaust a random card from your hand.

            - **Card 2:**
            - Type: Attack
            - Cost: 2
            - Deal 8 damage. Apply 2 Vulnerable.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 4 First:**
            - Gain Block, exhaust a random card. This can impact any card, but it’s important to note this does not specifically interact with Card 2’s mechanism or effects.

            - **Playing Card 2 Next:**
            - Playing Card 2 results in dealing 8 damage and applying 2 Vulnerable.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Playing Card 4 first gains Block and exhausts a random card. Neither the Block nor the exhaust effect change the effect of playing Card 2.
            - Playing Card 2 deals damage and applies Vulnerable. Card 4 does not have any specific {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} with any of these effects.

            ### Conclusion:
            Given that the risk of losing a card to exhaustion from Card 4 is an inherent risk not specific to Card 2, the sequence doesn't introduce any unique advantages or disadvantages specifically related to Card 2 beyond the inherent exhausting mechanic. Thus, there is no direct {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} effect due to playing these two cards in this exact order.

            - Gain 7 Block. Exhaust a random card from your hand.

            - Type: Attack
            - Cost: 4
            - Costs 1 less energy for each time you lose HP in combat. Deal 18 damage.

            ### Order of Events
            - **Playing Card 4 First:**
                - You gain 7 Block to protect against incoming damage, which is generally positive.       
                - A random card from your hand is exhausted. This is an effect inherent to Card 4 but doesn't specifically impact Card 1 more than any other card.

            - **Playing Card 1 Next:**
                - Costs 4 energy, potentially reduced by previous damage taken. If Card 4 was played in a previous turn, it could have blocked some of the incoming damage, which can prevent the cost reduction effect of Card 1.
                - Deals 18 damage, which is not affected by Card 4.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:
            - Gaining Block reduces the potential to take damage this turn, which could have reduced Card 1’s energy cost if the player would have taken HP loss.
            - Although gaining Block is beneficial for immediate protection, this effect is not an interaction between these two cards. What is specific to these cards is that this Block indirectly reduces the possibility of taking advantage of Card 1’s cost reduction mechanic.

            ### Conclusion:
            Considering the subtle negative synergy between gaining Block and potentially reducing Card 1's cost, the sequence can be considered a slight negative {SYNERGY_KEYWORD} due to the fact that playing Card 4 first may inadvertently result in a less optimal use of resources for playing Card 1.

            - **Playing Card 4 First:**
                - Provides 7 Block for protection.
                - Exhausts a random card from your hand as a part of its fundamental effect.

            - **Playing Card 4 Next:**
                - Adds another 7 Block, further boosting your defense.
                - Again exhausts a random card, removing a card from your hand.

            ### Analyzing the {SYNERGY_KEYWORD_CAPITALIZED}:  
            - Normally, we expect to gain Block and exhaust one card from our hand by playing Card 4.
            - Here, every time we play Card 4, we have this effect. There is no additional interaction that is a result of this exact combination.

            ### Conclusion:
            There’s no direct synergy or additional interplay between the two instances of Card 4 beyond their individual effects stacking.
